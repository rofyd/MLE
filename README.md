# Modified LatticeEasy
Simulating the production of oscillons and the resulting GW spectrum for my M.Sc. thesis.

Main code (LATTICEEASY and CLUSTEREASY) is taken from http://www.felderbooks.com/latticeeasy/

I am adding the necessary functions to:

* Calculate local energy densities
* Identify oscillons
* Calculate resulting GW
